                Do you know what happens when your <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">computer</em> uses all of its memory? Think about it like <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">this</em>. Say you had an empty <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">bucket</em>, which in this case would be your <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">computer</em>. Your bucket only has a certain amount of space that it can fit <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">stuff</em> inside. Equally your <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">computer</em> only has a certain amount of <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">memory</em> that it can use to load programs/files. <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">Now</em> let's say you start pouring water into this <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">bucket</em>. Cool, nothing happens and <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">everything</em> is fine. Then you notice when you are about <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">halfway</em> filled with the bucket, that this bucket is getting <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">pretty</em> heavy. Equally your computer will start to run slower once that <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">memory</em> is begins to fill up. Anyway let's keep on  <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">pouring</em>.

                <div class="logger-container">
                    <img src="assets\water.png" alt="">
                </div>
            <p>
                Once you fill about <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">90%</em> of the bucket you tell yourself <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">OMG</em> this bucket cannot move anymore because it is <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">soooo</em> heavy. You will notice <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">performance</em> issues when your computer is running <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">too</em> many programs at once. <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">What </em>will happen if you fill the bucket <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">all</em> the way? Well, the bucket is going to being to <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">overflow</em> and no longer be able to carry <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">anymore</em> water. So this leads us to what happens when your <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">computer</em> memory is full... <strong>YOUR COMPUTER WILL CRASH</strong>. As a type of <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">safety</em> measure your computer will <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">shut</em> itself off as it can no longer <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">fulfill</em> any more tasks.
            <p>
                What if you can <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">shut</em> someones computer off with 3 lines of <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">code</em>? (why are these things so easy) Let's take a <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">look</em> at how this can be done with some python wooooo.

                <pre>
                    <code class="language-python">
    import&nbsp;os
    while&nbsp;True:
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;os.startfile()
                    </code>
                </pre>
            <p>
                Isn't it scary how <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">simple</em> this is? Yes...this is literally all the code you <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">need</em> to crash anyones computer, including your <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">own</em> which leads me to my next point. <strong>DO NOT</strong> run this program on your local <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">machine</em>. Or any machine you <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">care</em> about for that matter. Make sure to run <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">this</em> program on a VM or something similar.
            <p>
                Let's explain what's <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">happening</em> here. First we import the python <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">os</em> module which is going to allow us to interact with the users <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">operating system</em>. Next we are just going to make an <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">infinite</em> loop of this file to <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">open</em> itself. <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">.startfile()</em> is just going to find the file path that is given and <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">execute</em> it. Let's add a few more <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">things</em> just to get it going.
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-python">
    import&nbsp;os
    while&nbsp;True:
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;os.startfile(__file__)
                    </code>
                </pre>
            <p>
                Okay nice, now we are <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">offically</em> finished. So inside of <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">.startfile()</em> we are going to give it the <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">file path</em> which is going to be <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">__file__</em> which in simple terms is the <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">same</em> file we are working on. Now we don't want it to be a <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">boring</em> .py file so let's spice it up a little. 
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-python">
    import&nbsp;os
    while&nbsp;True:
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;os.startfile(__file__[:&#45;2]+&quot;exe&quot;)
                    </code>
                </pre>
            <p>
                In order to <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">change</em> the file type we are going to do something called <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">index slicing</em> woaaa fancy...so we add brackets and tell the <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">program</em> to remove the last two characters of the <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">file</em> name which would be <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">py</em>. While we are at it let's add <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">exe</em> to the end of it instead...muahahaha. We are <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">done</em>, let's get to the fun part and execute it.
            <p>
                Like I stated <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">before</em> please <strong>ONLY</strong> run this on a virtual machine. Let's <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">boot</em> up our virtual windows machine.
            <div class="logger-container">
                <img src="assets\windowsloader.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>
                Now that our machine is up and <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">running</em> let's break it LOL. Watch what happens when we <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">run</em> our program.
            <div class="video-container">
                <video src="assets/compcrash.mp4" controls muted>
                </video>
            </div>
            <p>
                What I really want to <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">emphasize</em> is the task manager. You wil notice that the VM running on its <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">own</em> will average around ~10% cpu <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">usage</em> while idol. Notice when we run our <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">program</em> the cpu usage hits its <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">maximum</em> capacity almost instantly. This is because the program is <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">running</em> an infinite while loop to open the designated file. It <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">took</em> about 20 seconds after starting the <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">program</em> for the VM to crash and shut itself down. 
            <p>
                This is just an small <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">example</em> of how programs are able to manipulate what <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">your</em> computer can do. The last thing you want is to <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">download</em> a file that you believe is non malicious and after <em style="color: #e3a1a1;">running</em> it...oops your computer crashed.
